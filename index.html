        <h1>What is Rugby?</h1>

        <h2>Rugby is a fast-paced, full-energy sport that brings people together with its mix of power, strategy, and pure excitement. It's a game where anyone can find a place—whether you're quick on your feet, strong in the tackle, or smart with the ball. Every match is an adventure: you run, pass, kick, and work as a tight unit to outsmart the opposition and score epic tries. The best part? Rugby builds real friendships, confidence, and toughness on and off the field. If you're looking for a sport that challenges you, pushes you, and fills you with adrenaline every time you play—rugby is calling your name. Come learn, play, and be part of something unforgettable!</h2>
